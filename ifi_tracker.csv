"Note: CSIS methodology for estimating disbursements assumes full disbursement of emergency financing instruments as indicated by the financing institutions themselves. In the case of IMF and RFA lending, disbursements are based on press releases and correspond to actual disbursement schedules. However, disbursement schedules from other official sources, including many MDB operations, are often not included in public press announcements. For purposes of this dataset, we assume full disbursement of such operations, which likely results in an overestimation of MDB disbursements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
